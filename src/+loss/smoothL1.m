function loss = smoothL1( Y, T, W)
% Return the loss between the output obtained from
% the network(Y) and the expected output(T). The loss is weighted based on
% the weights stored in W.
%
% Inputs
%   Y - The output from the network
%   T - The target responses. 
%   W - The intance weights.
%
%   Y and T are the same size.
%
% Outputs
%   loss - the loss between Y and T. Set instance weights correctly
%   to achieve average loss. For example, W = 1/N, from most cases
%   where N is the number of observations.
