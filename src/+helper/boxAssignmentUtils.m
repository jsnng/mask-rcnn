            %
            % Inputs:
            %   boxes: An array of boxes (M1-by-4) stored as [x y width

            %
            %   groundTruthBoxes: An array of ground truth boxes (M2-by-4)
            %                     stored as [x y width height] bounding
            %                     boxes.
            %
            %   posOverlap: A two-element vector that specifies a range of
            %               bounding box overlap ratios between 0 and 1.
            %               Region proposals that overlap with ground truth
            %               bounding boxes within the specified range are
            %               used as positive training samples.
            %
            %   negOverlap: A two-element vector that specifies a range of
            %               bounding box overlap ratios between 0 and 1.
            %               Region proposals that overlap with ground truth

            %
            %   assignAllGroundTruthBoxes: A logical scalar. When true, all
            %                              ground truth boxes are assigned
            %                              to one of the boxes regardless

            %
            %   positiveIndex: A vector of logical indices of length
